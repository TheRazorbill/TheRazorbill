-  **I'm currently learning:** Diving deep into **JavaScript**, with a special focus on the **React** and **Node.js** ecosystem.
-  **In my free time:** I regularly solve algorithm challenges on **LeetCode** to keep my data structures and problem-solving skills sharp.

### Key Projects

[WhenEnds](https://whenends.netlify.app): I always knew when I gained access to a platform and for how long, but never how many days were left.
WhenEnds solves exactly that. A simple, fast, and self-explanatory product.

[Projeto-English-For-Devs](https://github.com/TheRazorbill/Projeto-English-For-Devs): The project connects the literal meaning of technical terms (e.g., Fetch = "Go get") to their logical function in the code, making learning more intuitive for Brazilian developers.

[Estude-Inteligente](https://github.com/TheRazorbill/Estude-Inteligente): The "Study Smarter" project is a web platform developed to help students discover their predominant learning style and find relevant resources, such as books, to optimize their studies.

[App-produtividade](https://github.com/TheRazorbill/app-produtividade): A to-do list application created with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (Recently refactored to TypeScript)
